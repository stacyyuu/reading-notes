## An Introduction to Node.JS

1. What is node.js?
- A JS runtime built on Chrome's V7 JS engine.
- An event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google's V8 JS engine and libuv library. 

2. In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?
- The V8 engine is the open-source JS engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. 
- It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JS directly to native machine code that your computer can execute. 
- The creator of Node took the V8 engine and enhanced it with various features, such as a file system API, an HTTP library, and a number of operating system-related utility methods. 

3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?
- This means Node.JS is a program we can use to execute JS on our computers. 

4. What is npm?
- NPM is a package manager for the JS programming language. 
- It comes bundled with Node when installed. 
- World's largest software registry. 

5. What version of node are you running on your machine?
- node -v : v18.4.0

6. What version of npm are you running on your machine?
- npm -v : 8.12.1

7. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?
- npm install -g jshint. (globally)

8. What is node used for?
- Node has execellent support for modern JS. 
- Installing (via npm) and running (via Node) various build tools - designed to automate the process of developing a modern JS app. 
- Many frameworks (and many other related packages) are available via npm and rely on Node to create a sensible development environment in which they can run. 
- Node lets us run JS on the server. 

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
- Greater efficiency: Takes slightly longer, but produces higher-quality code that doesn't require later effort in troubleshooting and debugging. 
- Engaged collaboration: More focused and more engaging. 
- Learning from fellow students: Exposes developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of. 
- Social skills: Great for improving social skills. Communication is key. 
- Job interview readiness: Being able to collaborate and communicate are important skills to a company. 
- Work environment readiness: Prepares you for working with your team in the real world. 

2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
- From my experience, the reason that has been most beneficial to me has been learning from fellow students. You are definitely more engaged in your work and it's very cool to see different ways of solving the same problem. It has also been very efficient when making sure there's no errors in the code. 

3. How does pair programming work?
- Pair programming commonly involves two roles: Driver and Navigator. 
- Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handles the mechanics of coding, the driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and of course - writing code. 
- Navigator uses their words to guide the driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The navigator may also utilize their second screen to look up solutions and documentation.
