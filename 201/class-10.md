## JS Debugging

### 7/9/22: Our reading today is based on JS debugging.

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
-   **Syntax Error**: Spelling errors, such as using the wrong special character or forgetting to add it. These are usually small fixes that are easy to miss. They are quick to fix without causing issues.
- **Logic Error**: Syntax is correct, but the actual code used is not working how it should. This means the program runs but does not produce correct results. These usually don't give you error messages so it is harder to fix especially if you are coding for a specific problem.

2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
-   I have encountered several syntax errors which I am ashamed to say. I am usually just one character off from having the correct code.
-   I have encountered logical errors as well, mostly when I am trying to find a solution to a problem and am testing different ideas.

3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
-   I don't know if I will ever be perfect at writing code so it is important to test as you go along. Using console.log has been very helpful in making sure I'm going along my steps correctly. 

4. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
-   Developer Tools - The Inspector: DOM explorer and CSS editor. Allows you to see how your HTML and CSS looks like at runtime so you can instantly modify and see changes. 

-   JavaScript Debugger - Allows you to watch the value of variables and set breakpoints, places in your code that you want to pause execution and identify the problems that prevent your code from executing properly. 
Chrome - Open developer tools and then select sources tab

5. Define what a breakpoint is.
-   In the debugger window, you can set **breakpoints** in the JS code. At each breakpoint, JS will stop executing, and let you examine JS values. After examining values, you can resume the execution of code (typically with a play button).

6. What is the call stack?
-   **Call stack** section shows you what code was executed to get the current line. 

-   Watch expressions - Expressions added
-   Scopes - Shows what values are visible from various points within your code
