## Engineer Readings

1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
- I have excellent communication and teamwork skills from many years of working in hospitality and as a dental provider. I have been very successful in building rapport with my patients and coworkers and I believe that is an very important skill to have. I also offer experience in the healthcare field. 

2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
- Before attempting to solve a problem, it is important to make sure you understand it and know how to explain what the goal is. 
- Plan your solution by creating a list of steps, a framework, and/or writing pseudo-code or comments. 
- Divide the problem into sub-problems and take them on step by step instead of trying to figure out the solution to the entire problem at once. 
- When stuck, I will debug and go step by step through my solutions. I will make sure there are not any mistakes or areas that may need tweaking. 
- I will also reassess my solution and see if there are other ways I can attempt to try and solve the problem. 
- It is always helpful to do research on the problem and see if there is information that can help me achieve my goal. 
- If I'm at a place where I've been spending a lot of time on one solution, I will take a break and work on something else or take some time away from working.
