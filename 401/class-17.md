### AWS Lambda Basics
1. What is AWS Lambda?
- Serverless computing service provided by AWS.

- The functions are executed in an efficient and flexible manner. 

2. Name some use cases for AWS Lambdas.
- Lambda functions can perform any kind of computing task, from serving web pages and processing streams of data to calling APIs and integrating with other AWS services. 

3. Describe “serverless” to a non-technical friend.
- Not needing to maintain your own servers to run these functions. 
- It is a fully managed service that takes care of all the infrastructure for you. 
- The servers, operating systems, network layer, and the rest of the infrastructure have already been taken care of so you can focus on writing the app code. 

### CDN
1. What is a CDN?
- Content Delivery Network. 
- Geographically distrubuted group of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of internet content. 
- Allows for fast transfer of data needed for loading internet content including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos. 

2. How does a CDN work with relation to the website visitor?
- CDNs work through servers nearest to the website visitor respond to the request. 
- When a user requests a webpage that is part of a CDN, it will redirect the request from the originating site’s server to a server in the CDN that is closest to the user and deliver the cached content.

3. What are the benefits of employing a CDN?
- Speeds up delivery of internet content.
- Protects your website against certain forms of cyber attacks. 
- It protects against threats because it allows the handling of more traffic and withstanding hardware failure better than many origin servers.
