## Stacks & Queues 

### Stack

- **Stack**: A data structure that consists of **Nodes** and uses Last In First Out. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous (ordered). Linear.
- **Push**: Nodes or items that are put into the stack are ***pushed***.
- **Pop**: Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are ***popped***. When you attempt to pop an empty stack, an exception will be raised. 
- **Top**: Top of the stack.
- **Peek**: Peek is used to view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack, an exception will be raised. 
- **isEmpty**: Returns true when stack is empty, otherwise returns false. 

### Concepts

- **First In Last Out** (FILO): The first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.
- **Last In First Out** (LIFO): The last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

### Queue

- **Queue**: A data structure that stores data sequentially based on First In First Out. Linear. 
- **Enqueue**: Nodes or items that are added to queue.
- **Dequeue**: Nodes or items that are removed from queue. If called when queue is empty, an exception will be raised.
- **Front**: Front/first Node of queue.
- **Rear**: Rear/last Node of queue.
- **Peek**: Peek is used to view the value of the front Node in queue. If called when queue is empty, an exception will be raised.
- **isEmpty**: Returns true when queue is empty, otherwise returns false. 

### Concepts

- **First In First Out** (FIFO): First item in queue will be the first item out of queue.
- **Last In Last Out** (LILO): Last item in queue will be the last item out of queue.
