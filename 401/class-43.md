# Open-Source Software Contribution 

- [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/) has some really great resources to use for your first time contributions. [Github](https://github.com/open-source) also has a webpage dedicated to open source contributions. 
- Open-Source software is a great way to improve your coding skills because you are practicing and collaborating with others, just like you would on a team. Like the article had mentioned, "few professions provide the means to practice on real projects." We don't always get the opportunity to gain feedback from those that are more experienced. 
- OSS is a great opportunity for new developers to gain more experience. It allows us to utilize the skills we have learned and put them to work. We are able to practice reading code, debugging, and writing out own code. 
- OSS allows us to create more opportunities and also interact with the community. There is a chance we may be recognized by a peer and be able to gain a larger network.
- OSS can also help improve chances of job opportunities. Those who are hiring can view your code and see what work you are capable of. 
- Lastly, OSS can allow software to improve on a user and a business level. With the option to contribute to code or suggest new features. It allows developers to consider different ideas and approaches.
