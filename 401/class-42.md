### Ethics in Workplace
It was interesting reading these articles and seeing how the employees reacted when their products were being used in unethical ways. It is important for the employees to stand up for themselves when they believe their work in being used for wrong. I'm really glad to see that they've done that, especially in big companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Amazon. Even big companies are capable of being unethical. It inspires me as a future Developer to be mindful of my purpose for my work and to speak out when I feel it is violating the code of ethics. 

### Ethics in Tech
Reading about the self-driving car ethics, it makes me think of how many situations they have to consider in the technology. Just like how the article states, "How these questions get answered may be important to the development and acceptance of self-driving cars". I definitely agree on that side. It's important to talk about ethics if this technology is going to serve all of society. The biggest challenge will be incorporating these situations and reactions to the technology. Another person mentioned, "We have the responsibility of deliberation," which I believe is a great point, because we have a chance to respond to situations based on our own consciousness. It seems like the self-driving technology would need to go through a lot of testing to gain the trust of society. 

### Tech Company Principles 
I like how positive the principles for Microsoft's AI is. I also really like how Google had multiple principles that shows they hold themselves to high standards and want their work to be as ethical as possible. They both seem well though out and would make me feel comfortable working in their companies, knowing they take this seriously. The Ethical OS looks like a great checklist that can be considered in any team that is thinking of how their work may impact society.
