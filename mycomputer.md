# Coder's Computer

**6/21/22**
 ### Today, in Code 102 we went through the process of preparing our computers for coding and interacted with Terminal. We also learned about text editors.

 ---

 A **text editor** is software you install on your computer, or accessed online, that allows you to create and manage text, especially the text used to create a website. It is considered one of the most important tools as an asipiring developer. 
- Choosing a text editor to use for your code ultimately depends on your own personal preference. This also comes with experience in using multiple text editors. 
- Text editors may include different features such as: Code completion, syntax highlighting, variety of themes, and availability of extensions. 
- **Code completion**: Displays possible suggestions based on what you start typing. This saves you time and helps prevent errors. Some code completion will also include the closing of brackets when you open them. 
- **Syntax highlighting**: Colorizes the text by the type of value you are inputting. 
- **Themes**: Cutomization of the text editor and your text. This can help reduce eye strain and fatigue. 
- **Extensions**: Allows you to add on other software that can assist in your text editing. It is important for your text editor to be up to date and as helpful as it can be.
