**6/20/22**
### Today, in Code 102 we learned how to use Markdown on Github. 

---

**Github** is used as a coding platform for people to share their projects and collaborate. 

Syntax notes of Markdown:
* Using # will create the largest header 
* Using ## will create the second largest header and so on...
* Using ** ** around a word or sentence will **bold** your text
* Using * * will *italize* your text
* To create an unordered list you can place * or - in front of each itemed list
* You can also use numbers before each item 
* You can add emojis by using :emojicode:, typing in : will give you a suggested list
