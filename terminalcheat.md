### Important Concepts
- **Relative path**: A file or directory location relative to where we are currently in the file system. 
- **Absolute path**: A fire or directory location in relation to the root of the file system. 
- Everything is a file. A text is a file, a directory is a file, your keyboard is a file, your monitor is a file, etc. 
- Linux is an extensionless system. Examples of extensions include: exe, txt, png. To find out what certain type a file is you can use a command, **file[path]**.
- Linux is case sensitive so it is important not to change capatalization when typing in a file.
